Description:
    First I create an String to store the sentence where the letter comes from. Then I create a character class and object for each letter to store the position and speed of letter we pick and draw them on canvas. Third, I create a variable called toggleView to toggle between user view and debugging view by pressing spacebar.finally, I flip the inputImage by changing its x and y position.
